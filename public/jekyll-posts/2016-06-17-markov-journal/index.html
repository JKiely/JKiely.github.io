          <p>So for a while now I&rsquo;ve been keeping a journal using Emacs Org Journal, mostly to chronicle various ideas and to shout at myself. I&rsquo;ve had a few problems with it, but I&rsquo;m mostly quite satisfied, and in contrast to my previous journal tools I love having everything easily accessible in plain text. In fact I was inspired by a friends project to take advantage of this accessibility and use it as a corpus to try and generate automatic journal-like sentences. I thought this project might teach me a little bit about myself, but I was apprehensive since whatever it would teach me was likely to be <em>horrifically</em> depressing.</p>

<p>So I thought I&rsquo;d start out with a simple bigram Markov model. And while I know there are plenty of libraries that implement this for me I&rsquo;ve never worked with these kind of things before so I wanted to implement it myself in order to learn more about them. This was my first attempt:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/JKiely/aea941ca3e6d90f14b25f1470835e7e0.js"></script>

<p>And it got me lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;so many distractions, it's just need to be noble in the intensity now, I'm using that one last time online, read&quot;

&quot;never happens. Library. Bring the basic vertion, and then bam, I'm an interveiw for the world if I also need to&quot;

&quot;the worst thing and just get to redirect my walking will be nervous about how I wonder if it that might be nervous about your fucking&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>So&hellip; yeah&hellip; Between my small relatively small corpus and the simplicity of the bigram model it turned out basically nonsensical. Though for all I know, I&rsquo;ve actually texted someone the third one at 3am.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t really do anything about the small size of the corpus but I could improve the model. Rather than just making it spit out trigram models I decided it would be best to make a more general ngram implementation:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/JKiely/76e2766d7506bad5ce5d83008d07eb43.js"></script>

<p>Which worked a bit better and resulted in:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Umwelt is a weird millionair who has no plans to let people define custom states.&quot;

&quot;It is rarely the physical injury but the damange to the status of art in itself, and it would be blocked forever&quot;

&quot;I'm there. I need to push myself harder on the scheme book, prepping for the throaty annoyed/exaperated sigh/growl I like the young&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>A lot of the results seem like they could be extracts from real text, although I promise my journal was never as creepy as the third one. And yeah, I&rsquo;m aware that this would have gone a lot smoother if I&rsquo;d spellchecked my journal as I wrote.</p>

<p>Unfortunately four-grams mostly resulted in it spitting out sentences from the journal verbatim, so I guess I&rsquo;ve reached the limit of what I can do with my small corpus with this method. Though I would be interested in mixing the journal files up with other things I&rsquo;ve written and trying out some other models on them.</p>

<p>All the code I wrote for this can be found <a href="https://github.com/JKiely/markov">here</a>.</p>
