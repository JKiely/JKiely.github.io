<p>I though it might be nice to recap the year with a list of the books I&rsquo;ve read. Before I sat down to start writing I was expecting this list to be a lot shorter, and I was plesently supprised! But I still hope to make it longer next year!</p>

<p>So without further ado, here are all of the books I remember reading in 2016, with comments added whereever I feel like it.</p>

<h2 id="non-fiction">Non-Fiction</h2>

<ul>
<li>A fun little book that takes a naturalists approach to the animals all around us. The auther is based in Berkeley, and so naturally investigates the animals he finds there, but since he&rsquo;s focusing on synanthropes most of them can also be found in London (and probably most other cities).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230">Grokking Algorithms</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Statistically-Uri-Bram-ebook/dp/B005YOL2Z4">Thinking Statistically</a>

<ul>
<li>Really short and really cheap. It gaves some clear expliantions of a few statistical concepts that attempt to make it easy to apply them to real situations.</li>
