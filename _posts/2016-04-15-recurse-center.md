Holy Fucking Shit I'm going to the Recurse Center!
  
**What is the Recurse Center?** Well it's kind of a writers retreat for programmers, a place you can go to work on whatever you want for three months and with support and guidance from some fantastic people and a brillient community. It's completely free, they make their money by getting jobs for the alumni and charging the companies a recrutment fee, which is a win win for me. Oh! And they're based in New York!
  
**What will I work on?** I really want to get better at web technologies and python, but it's really hard to narrow down my focus. I'll probably end up doing a lot of side projects based on ideas I have and people I meet while I'm there. I really just want to get a better understanding of the tools I use, I know how to write code in python and how to build things in various web frameworks, but I don't always understand why things work the way they do. I think RC is the perfect environment to start to fix that.

I'm really looking forward to going to New York and being part of this community. I have no idea where I'll go next, wherever I get a job offer I guess, but I don't think I'll be back in London for a while.
It's going to be a great journey!
