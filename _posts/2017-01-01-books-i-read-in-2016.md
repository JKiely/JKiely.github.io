I though it might be nice to recap the year with a list of the books I've read. Before I sat down to start writing I was expecting this list to be a lot shorter, and I was plesently supprised! But I still hope to make it longer next year!

So without further ado, here are all of the books I remember reading in 2016, with comments added whereever I feel like it. 

## Non-Fiction
* [Unseen City: The Majesty of Pigeons, the Discreet Charm of Snails & Other Wonders of the Urban Wilderness](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Unseen-City-Majesty-Discreet-Wilderness/dp/1623363853)
  * A fun little book that takes a naturalists approach to the animals all around us. The auther is based in Berkeley, and so naturally investigates the animals he finds there, but since he's focusing on synanthropes most of them can also be found in London (and probably most other cities).
* [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230)
* [Thinking Statistically](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Statistically-Uri-Bram-ebook/dp/B005YOL2Z4)
  * Really short and really cheap. It gaves some clear expliantions of a few statistical concepts that attempt to make it easy to apply them to real situations. 
* [Doing Good Better](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Difference/dp/1783350512/)

  * Literally the only book I managed to finish while I was in the states. It was the first economic history book I've read but it made me really intrested in reading further.

* [Social Network Analysis for Startups: Finding connections on the social web](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Social-Network-Analysis-Startups-connections/dp/1449306462/)
  * Sometimes when I learn a new idea (like Automata or Memetics) it makes me impossible to talk to for months, since I insist on using it to explain absolutly everything. Soical network analysis is apparently on of those idea, and I'm really excited to get deeper into this field.
* [How to write a Thesis](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Write-Thesis-MIT-Press-ebook/dp/B00UMIT5J2/)
