One of the other languages I've been dabbling in in C. This wasn't really planned but after chatting with the most recent resident Spencer Russell about implementing a regex parser, he offered to pair with me on it to help me learn C. That was a little too good an opportunity to pass up.

We worked on it for about six hours, with most of that time being spent on teaching me how C works and figuring out a broad implementation strategy. So far all our parser can do is take a given DFA and check if it matches on a string, it can't yet generate a DFA from a regex string, or return the exact part of the string that matches. But still, I think I'm in a good position to continue.

So far C has not been as hard as I feared. I've certainly benefited from being exposed to most of the concepts before in other, easier to learn, languages. But even so, I still have a lot to learn about pointers, and perhaps I've been spoiled by the explanatory error messages in those easy to learn languages.
