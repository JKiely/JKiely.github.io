Week three was a bit more scattered that the previous two, the bittorrent group all got a bit distracted by other things and in the absence of that I mostly worked on solo projects. Naturally this led to me being a bit less productive that I otherwise would have been, but I did give me a chance to think more about what I want to work on.

I need to move away from working on things I find in articles and tutorials and build more original things, or at least implement things my own way. When I do work from tutorials, such as the Go weather server, I should also make at effort to expand the final product into something I can present as at least partly my own. This was especially hammered in when I worked on my CV and had to look for code examples. Everything I had was either from a tutorial or half finished. I need to spend some of my solo project time finishing up a few things so that I have code samples to present.

As for what I actually did work on, well as I said last week I had two projects in mind. Firstly the 500 line Python interpreter: This project has been going alright, even if I've not worked on it as much as I would have liked. So far it's been a really clear explanation of how the interpreter works and I've already learnt a tonne. But there is a bit more 'magic' that I was expecting (although, perhaps no more than I should have expected) and I'm going to have to learn a lot more if I want to be able to implement even a small version in another language.

My experience with Go so far has been to follow a few simple tutorials, including a site that checks and averages the results of weather APIs, and one afternoon of pairing on an open source command line tool. The tutorials were somewhat useful, and I plan on expanding the weather API one into something a bit more interesting, but frankly I'm not going to learn anything until I have my own projects. That's why I appreciate Willa letting me pair on the tool with her, she's been giving me great insight into how go is actually written and the go ecosystem, as well as giving me a chance to work on something people will actually use.

This coming week I need to pair more (I'm pretty sure I say that every week, but it's never not true), finish up the interpreter, and get back on track with the bittorrent client.
