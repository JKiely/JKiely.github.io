One of the best parts of the Recurse Center for me has been constantly having people to collaberate with. At first I was one of the pairing skeptics, when I was learning at the bootcamp I thought that by learning on my own I'd be free to follow up on things that intrested me, and really stick with every thing until I got it. I worried that working with people would not only distract me, but it would also make me self-concious, scared to admit when I was struggling. But after a while it became obvious I was wrong, the people who made a habit of paring were not only making better progress than me, but they were also learning how to colaberate and communicate about their code.

So this time around I resolved to do better







This arrangement leaves the driver free to work on the tactical challenges of creating rigorous, syntactically correct code without worrying about the big picture, and it gives the navigator the opportunity to consider strategic issues without being distracted by the details of coding.

When pairing, you'll have positive peer pressure to perform these difficult but crucial tasks

you'll find yourself paying more attention to the conversation with your programming partner than surrounding noise; it fades into the background. #Like a fountain in the park

Paired programmers produce code through conversation.
