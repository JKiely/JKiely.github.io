My main aim when I first arrived at RC was to better understand the python web stack (wrong word, change it later). I wanted to know exactly how my server and framework functioned so that I could spend less time googling random errors and more time implimenting cool features.

So I decided to start this adventure by building a server


#What is a server?


#What kind of server are we building?
##Concurrent
##WSGI
