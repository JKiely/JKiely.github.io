Just finished reading this great little book. At only 78 pages it doesn't try to cover much, but it picks three rather useful ideas from statistics and explains them well with no (well, very little) math. The goal of the books is to show that these ideas are useful and applicable to our every day lives without knowing the mathamatical formalisms.

The areas it chooses to focus on are Selection Bias, Models, and Bayes Theorem. Even as someone who was already familir with these ideas I really apreciated the clear and preice explinations.
