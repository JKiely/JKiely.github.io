* [Think Complexity](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Complexity-Science-Computational-Modeling/dp/1449314635)
  * Even though I rushed though this without doing any of the exercises and very little of the recomended reading I really enjoyed it and I absolutely want to come back to it when I have more time. 
* [High Performance Python](https://www.amazon.co.uk/High-Performance-Python-Performant-Programming/dp/1449361595)
* [Building Microservices](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1491950358/)

Papers

* [Programming as Theory Building](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf)
  * Argues that programming should be though of not as 'source code production' but as building a theory by which to model the system in question. Thus a programmers job is to come up with a model of how a system works, and how to map that model on to the symbolic manipulations of a computer. And so when a new programmer is to be introduced to the code base, it's not enough to throughly introdue them to the text of the code and give them documentation to read, they must be introduced to the core theory and shown how the text of the program maps onto it. Also, a lot of the paper is spent arguing against formal methods, and I guess it won since I've never heard of any of them? 
* [Eliza](https://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist238/p36-weizenabaum.pdf)
  * A paper introducing the worlds first chat bot. Some of the technical detals, such as how they used a their time sharing system to make it work are a little lost on me, and it was facinating to realise I was reading an explination that seems to come from a time before they were common knowledge. But overall it gave me a good idea of how to impliment a version of the bot.
* [Collective dynamics of ‘small-world’ networks](http://barabasilab.neu.edu/courses/phys5116/content/watts_strogatz.pdf)
* [Should Computer Scientistsf Experiment More?](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/teaching/spring2005/fft/moreexperiments.pdf)
  * Argues that computer scientests should conduct more experements in order to validate ideas that are not fully understood theoretically and make sure efforts are being spent in productive directions, and debunks 16 reasons not to. The arguments certainly sound convincing but I'm hardly in a position to come down too strongly on it.
