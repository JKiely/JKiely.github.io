It's been a few year since I last read The Illiad, but I still think about the book a lot. It's central conflict between living a long lesurely life and hardly being remembered, or living a short brutal one that may grant you "Kleos Aphthiton"<sup>[1]</sup> really caught my intrest when I first read it and never really let go.


Still, another feature of the book that grabbed me was just how damn capitalist the gods are. The Christian gods in comparison talk about exulting the poor, and each giving what they can and worshiping in their own way. None of that shit here however. Agamemnon has all the fatted bulls, he can burn all the bones, and so he gets all the favor. The only way you can compete with him is to out spend him:
        
    "Zeus has changed his mind, and inclines towards Hector's sacrifices rather than ours." (Book IX)

Yeah, so another long term investor in Zeus enterprises has bought up more shares and is now controling the direction the company takes.

##Maybe I should make this a lobbying analogy instead

Of course that makes me wonder why none of the hero's exploit this. Why, when they're splitting up the loot, is everyone worried about armor and concubines but never the fatted bulls? You take all of those 'invest' them wisely in your next conflict, and bam, you've siddenly got even more bulls to sacrifice and you've even taken some armor and slaves as 'dividents'.

This is *bullshit*. the system is rigged! The exulted get exulted-er, and the rest of us just get conquored. We need to orgenise. We need to redistribute the bulloks of the 1%. Occupy Olympus!



[1] Well, not quite 'aphthiton', another theme of the book is how no man made thing can last.
