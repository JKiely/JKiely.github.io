So I useto think about the ship of thesus problem a lot when I was younger. But of course I didn't know that's what it was called back then, I wouldn't hear about the philosophical problem until I was in my twenties. See what I thought I was thinking about, was Pimp My Ride.

See, every episode Exibit (or whoever hosted the European version) would take somenes car, some beat up old wreck, and 'pimp' it. They would replace the wheels, the interior, the engine, the body... you see where I'm going with this right? And it would never be all of the car, something would always remain (I think), but the pimped car would be presented as the same car, just different in every way. But was it really, or were the few episodes where they bought them a new car outright not as anomilous as they seemed?

But while it would be fun to teese the show, and argue that they were just building them a brand new custom car each week, I actually think that I was the same car. And I'm going to show you why.

(I also think it was the same damn ship as well)

Sameness is a social construct, although it's more useful to notice how thingness is a social construct. And sameness is really just a way of discribing objective relationships between those fuzzily defined things. For example what is a chair? Is it a thing with four legs, a seat and a back? What about it it has one leg? No back? Just a seat? is a rock a chair? Chairs are things that people have come to define as chairs, and the catagory chair is just a network with links representing shared attributes. How do we decided if a new object is a chair? We see how many things link it to the catagory and make a qualitative judgement. This introduces two qualitative judgement points: Firstly the point of how many points are enough, and secondly what constitutes a link? It's this second point that intrests me the most.

//But is the bit about relationships determining whether we see it as part of the set even accurate? Objects are also defined by function and just being social accepted. It could be a chair is anything that's used in the place you'd expect a chair but that isn't so differnt as to cause you to actively judge it.
//But then there's the case of why I assume certain objects are chairs even when found in a non chair context. Such as being found folded up under the sofa. I assume they're chairs because they are similar to (share features with) chairs I've seen before.
//But surely there are chairs that have far more in common with benches or tables, but are not in that catatory. So some edges are more important that others? I guess they could be weighted edges.
//Also features are not monolithic, folding would encompas many kinds of folding chair, which would need it's own 'catagory graph' to define it. So perhaps 'fracal' bimodal graphs?

If we veiw a car as a connection of elemnts making up the catagory 'this car' then we can generalise our definition of sameness. A new part is in the catagory 'this car' (i.e part of the car') if it a sufficent links, and that those links were accepted. This accepted compoant is what makes it social constructed. After all we accept a new body part as a real part of the car under most circamstances, same with a spoiler kit added.




Imagine a family, these people are considered to be related to each other so long as all of relatioships between them are seen as legitimate. If someone marries in, that's legitimate, adoption, legitimage. But a girlfriend, or someone who just lives there? Nope. Even after members of the family die it keeps being the same family because the bundle of relationships never goes away. Even centures later when no one alive has even met anyone from the 'original' family, it's the same family. What's important is that at every stage the new member were being added in a legitimate fasion. They them become part of the set, and allow new member to be connected to them just furthering the existance of the group beyond them
